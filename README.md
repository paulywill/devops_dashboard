# devops_dashboard
A personal dashboard to demonstrate/learn DevOps tools and related concepts and technology.

This is an attempt to flesh out an idea to level up my skills and demonstrate to future employers.

It is not a particle solution but ideally a cobbled set of features using different technologies/stacks together.

## User Story:

A personal dashboard used on a daily basis by the user (Bob) to update different areas of life. He is already using a few Google sheets to track and monitor different areas of his life, now Google Sheet is starting to become too tedious and not scaling with this needs.

Bob, logs in (using standard SSO or OAuth) and updates 'status' on different areas of his life (wealth/health/learning/love) and receive some feedback on stats.

## Main Feature:

As Bob updates and reflects on stats, there is a workflow and explaination of the technology running in the background. It would be as if there was a plexiglass to the front-end / back-end / and working instructure normally invisible to Bob.

The feedback will be a real-time console and flow chart of what is happening.

## Skills / Technology:

The main purpose is use the 'User Story' as a pre-text to use a technology. There would rarely be the need for the multiple DevOp tools to be used together, but each feature would in theory attempt to use them to showcase their ability and workings. In the end it would be interesting to 'glue them together'.

Unsorted list taken in part from this [article](https://www.linux.com/news/7-essential-open-source-devops-projects/) (_should note:_  grouping is my interpretation)  :

### Configuration Management 
- \[ ]  [Chef](https://www.chef.io/chef/)
- \[ ]  [Puppet](https://puppet.com/)
- \[ ]  [Ansible](https://www.ansible.com/)
- \[ ]  [SaltStack](https://saltstack.com/)


### Provisioning Tools
- \[ ]  [CloudFormation](https://aws.amazon.com/cloudformation/)
- \[ ]  [TerraForm](https://www.terraform.io/)

### Containers
- \[ ]  [Docker](https://www.docker.com/)
- \[ ]  [Kubernetes](http://kubernetes.io/)

### CI/CD
- \[ ]  [Jenkins](https://jenkins.io/)

### Cloud Services
- \[ ]  [AWS](https://aws.amazon.com)
- \[ ]  [GC](https://cloud.google.com)
- \[ ]  [Azure](https://azure.microsoft.com)


## Bonus:

Could use and showcase multiple front-ends and different languages as well. Uncertain if it's even possible to glue these together or if there has to be a toggle switch.

- \[ ] [Ruby on Rails (v6+)](https://rubyonrails.org/)
- \[ ] [ReactJS](https://reactjs.org/)
- \[ ] [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org)
- \[ ] [Django](https://www.djangoproject.com)
- \[ ] [Flask](https://github.com/pallets/flask)

## Bonus Bonus
- \[ ] iOS
- \[ ] Android



## Concerns:

- I would like a limited budget. Perhaps demonstrate cost running on each cloud service (per Month / per Bob).
Well under $100 USD is probably.

- Depth of learning. It's tempting to run through a list and make some shallow and 'hello world' across the board without deep diving into the subtleties. A slow sip coffee rather than a quick shot of esspresso might be needed. e.g. Obtaining my AWS Developer Associate certification took longer than anticipated.

- Spin-offs. I do have "other ideas" as I'm sure we all do of well intended start-ups we never got around to. There's a possibly to spin something off I learn which would that mean I would probably abandon this project.
